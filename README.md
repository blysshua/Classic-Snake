# Classic-Snake
Classic Snake for terminal

This is a simple Classic Snake game I made for the linux terminal written in bash.
It's my first time uploading code to github, and I am learning how to write scripts for linux and exploring the open source community

### Installation:

  in terminal:
```bash  
git clone https://github.com/blysshua/Classic-Snake.git

cd Classic-Snake

chmod +x snake.sh

./snake.sh
```


I used nerdfonts for

SNAKE_HEAD=''

FOOD=''

However, you can replace it with any symbols or install nerdfonts to render more icons:

### Optional:

create an alias in bashrc:
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc

alias snake="/home/<username>/Classic‑Snake/snake.sh"
```



In future iterations I would like to add a variety of fruits that have different effects or gives abilities. But right now it's just the simple base game of Classic Snake.
