Classic Snake for terminal

This is a simple Classic Snake game I made for the linux terminal written in bash.
It's my first time uploading code to github, and I am learning how to write scripts for linux and exploring the open source community 


I used nerdfonts for

SNAKE_HEAD=''
FOOD=''

However, you can replace it with any symbols or install nerdfonts to render more icons:

In future iterations I would like to add a variety of fruits that have different effects or gives abilities. But right now it's just the simple base game of Classic Snake.
